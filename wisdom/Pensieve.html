Wisdom
-There's no such thing as right or wrong. Its all about how you justify it.
-A conversation is as interesting as the questions that are answered by it
-I'd rather be healthy and poor than rich and sick
--Remember this when skipping out on the gym to do work
-Stick to the deals you cut for yourself "I'll just play one more game..."

Identity
-I love to organize, categorize, make lists, archive, store, keep-for-later, and write down thoughts, tasks, and almost anything that I can think of. 
    - I know I'm not the only person who organizes (see below) and is trying to store all of their thoughts in a diary, BUT I wonder how many other people are as obsessive about it. 
    - I wonder WHY I am so obssessed with this. What caused my fascination? Have I always been a categorizer? 
    - Does this count as a passion? Or is it just a distraction, and an unacknowledged form of procrastination
    - What would go wrong if I stopped this habit? I get a nice nostalgia from re-discovering my work, but I spent 90% of the time writing/producing, and only 10% of time going back and reading/looking at it.
