    -What does this lyric mean
        -Who is this artist
    -How can my plant grow
    -YouTube video of what I should study > suggested videos > horrific truck accidents

-I get an uncomfortable feeling I get when I stifle my impulse to search up the answer to these type of random questions

Shower during the least productive time of the day, since it is a pretty non-brain intensive activity
