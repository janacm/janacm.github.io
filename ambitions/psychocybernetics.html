		<h1> Psycho Cybernetics </h1>
		<h2> What is Psycho Cybernetics?</h2>
		Psycho Cybernetics is a self-help book created by Maxwell Maltz, a German plastic surgeon. Maltz claims that you can achieve your goals, if:
		<ol>
			<li> You can clearly communicate your goals to your sub-conscious </li>
			<li> You self-image is consistent with these goals.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2> Does it work? </h2>
<p> Number of life goals achieved is obviously not a very scientific variable to measure. The only way I can determine if it works, is by trying it myself. Its free, and at the worst I would have spent time learning more about what is important to me, which is not a waste of time in my opinion. Also, I would like to read enough self-help material so that I can write my own book some day. </p>

		<p> Below, are the necessary questions to answer in order to start "using" Psycho Cybernetics. I have also added my own answers. At the end, you can choose to download your answers. </p>

		<h2>1) WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS</h2>
		<p> This question is vague, so lets split them up into long term and short term goals. For daily Psycho Cybernetics use <a href="dailyPC.html"> this form. </a></p>

		<h2>2) WHAT IS YOUR SELF-IMAGE </h2>
		<p> Positive thinking and setting goals will not work unless you view yourself as someone who can actually accomplish these goals. "But how can I believe that I'm someone who can accomplish goals that I've yet to accomplish, if I haven't accomplished them yet!?". Your brain will experience the <em> imagining</em> yourself achieving goals, has a similar effect on yourself self-image as actually achieving in real life. I proved this to myself by imagining the smell of certain foods can get my stomach grumbling, which is a physical effect to an imagined thought.
