		<h1> Psycho Cybernetics </h1>
		This is a self-help book created by a plastic surgeon, Maxwell Maltz. Maltz claims that you can achieve anything, provided the following:
		<ol>
			<li> You can clearly communicate your goals to your sub-conscious </li>
			<li> You self-image is consistent with these goals.</li> 
		</ol>
		<p> This is obviously not very scientific, but can any type of self-help book ever be? Perhaps if we could monitor the changes in the brain when it comes to proponents of success, such as resilience, motivation, energy, .etc. so the only way I can determine if it works, is by trying it myself. I would like to read enough self-help books so that I can be an authority on the subject and even write my own book some day. </p>

		<p> Below, are the necessary questions to answer in order to start "using" Psycho Cybernetics. I have also added my own answers. At the end, you can choose to download your answers. </p>

		<h2>1) WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS</h2> 
		<p> This question is vague, so lets split them up into long term and short term goals</p> 
		<h2>2) WHAT IS YOUR SELF-IMAGE </h2> 
		<p> Positive thinking and setting goals will not work unless you view yourself as someone who can actually accomplish these goals. "But how can I believe that I'm someone who can accomplish goals that I've yet to accomplish, if I haven't accomplished them yet!?". Your brain will experience the <em> imagining</em> yourself achieving goals, has a similar effect on yourself self-image as actually achieving in real life. I proved this to myself by imagining the smell of certain foods can get my stomach grumbling, which is a physical effect to an imagined thought.
