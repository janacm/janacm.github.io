		<h2> What is Psycho Cybernetics?</h2>
		Psycho Cybernetics is a self-help book created by Maxwell Maltz, a German plastic surgeon. Maltz claims that you can achieve your goals, if:
		<ol>
			<li> You can clearly communicate your goals to your sub-conscious </li>
			<li> You self-image is consistent with these goals.</li>
		</ol>
		<p> Below, are the necessary questions to answer in order to start "using" Psycho Cybernetics. I have also added my own answers. At the end, you can choose to download your answers. </p>

		<h2>1) WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS</h2>
		<p> What do you want from life? </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Have completed projects</li>
					<li>Make open source contributions</li>
					<li>Become better front-end developer</li>
				</ul>
			<li>To have a startup </li>

		<h2>2) WHAT IS YOUR SELF-IMAGE </h2>
	<p> Positive thinking and setting goals will not work unless you believe you can accomplish these goals.
			Your brain will experience the <em> imagining</em> yourself achieving goals, has a similar effect on yourself self-image as actually achieving in real life. I proved this to myself by imagining the smell of certain foods can get my stomach grumbling, which is a physical effect to an imagined thought.
