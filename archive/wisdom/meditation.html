-My meditation started out with my mind getting lost in random thoughts
-Near the end, I started to get a feeling. It felt strange, like something was happening inside my mind - I also felt it in my chest.
-I told myself to embrace the feeling, and not to be afraid of it or to repress it. I wanted to encourage it, because I believed *that* was the feeling of meditation
-I started to become engulfed in a bright whiteness

Other notes:
-Prior to my meditation, I was wondering "what should meditation feel like" and I wrote it down in my todo list to look it up.
