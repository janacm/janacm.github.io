##Advice I got from recruiters
###Resume Tips

- What did you *learn* at the job
- What was your role in the group
    - "Single handedly did a thing"
- Add expected graduation date
    - How long it takes for you to finish your degree doesn't matter
    - Just have projects/work-experience as your justification
- Add online courses/certificates
- Think about what the company cares about
    - "What does Microsoft care about? You built a Windows 8 app"
- Did you go above and beyond at your job?
    - "Convinced management to do something"
    - "Decreased load time by 30%"
- Show that you set goals and achieved them
    - "Goal oriented"
    - I give myself deadlines
- Have an app on the store
- Nothing is stopping you from hacking together a quick project
    - 30 mins a day is all it takes
- Have relevant projects (fixing computers for friends and family is irrelevant)

### Other tips (change this if possible)
- Ideas and creativiity can come from frustration
    - Transgaming video card story

-bucket effect
-- if you build one side of the bucket high, you won't be able to fill the bucket that high (on being a well-rounded person)
