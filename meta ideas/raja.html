		<p> Rajathithan Kathiravelu. Raja mama to me. </p> 
		<p> Raja mama died this week, and I just got back from the funeral. I'm on my way back to Ottawa, and I have a few hours to reflect.</p> 
		<h4> My speech </h4>
		<p> My name is Janac. Raja mama is my Thai-Maman (mother's brother). When I was 10 or 11 years old, Raja mama lived at my house for a few months while he was renovation our basement. I was his little helper, doing simple things like getting him the phillips screwdriver or the hammer. I got to learn how to paint, put up drywall, install tiles, use a tile cutter, mixing concrete and other skills. I spent hours with him, and sometimes he would talk to me about important subjects such as family and career. He mentioned that he loves my mom more than she knows. I was too young to understand what an amazing opportunity I had to talk to the most experienced, and well traveled person I would ever meet. I was too young to know what questions to ask. Last month, I turned 22. Now I know what I wanted to ask him.</p>
		<p>Raja mama, my friends and I want to go on a trip. We were thinking of going to Cuba, what do you think? Have you been there before? What? You've been to 74 countries but not there? Should I go to Dominican instead? Noo, I can't go to both! Yeah, school is going good, I'm finally graduating next year. I know, you always tell me that school comes first. Don't worry, I'm finally graduating and you won't have to tell me that anymore. </p>
		<p> The last memory I have of Raja mama's voice is during Rathi's reception. The part came where the groom kisses the bride. Gobi planted on a nice kiss on Rathi infront of everyone, and Raja mama was walking past our table, smiling and laughing he said "Ah-hah, ah-hah, appanuku munnalae kiss pannuran!" ("He's kissing in front of the father of the bride!"). </p>
		<p> Everyone knows that Raja mama likes to travel by air plane. He probably spent more time in the sky than on the ground. Now, he will forever be in the sky, always watching over us.
