		<h1>Healthy Footwear</h1>
		<p>I've heard stories about people with knee and back problems after excericsing in the wrong shoes. I want to start running every week, so I've done some research on what a "healthy" shoe is.</p>

		<h2>Results of Research</h2>
		<strong>I'm going to buy Vibram Komodo Sports</strong>
		<p><a href="http://wellnessmama.com/8264/healthy-shoes/">Wellness Mama</a> has done an excellent review of barefoot running, and provided academic sources for her claims.</p>
		<p>Below is a collection of stuff I learned throughout my research. The most important takeaway from my research is <strong>DO NOT STRIKE THE GROUND HEEL FIRST WHILE RUNNING</strong>. Every single article/page I read had mentioned this fact.</p>
		<h3>How to know a shoe fits</h3>
		<a href="https://howespharmacy.com/library.php?id=647179">Howe's Pharmacy has great advice:</a> 
		<p>From there website: </p>
			<li>There should be a half-inch between the tip of your longest toe and the end of the shoe.</li>
			<li>Try on both shoes; one foot is usually bigger than the other.</li>
			<li>Make sure the ball of your foot fits easily in the widest part of the shoe. Likewise, your heel shouldn't slip around in the back of the shoe.</li>
			<li>Shop in the late afternoon when your feet are slightly swollen, especially if you typically exercise after work.</li>
		<li></li>
		<h3>Vibrams</h3>
		<em>...aka the shoes with the fingers</em>
		<h4>Lawsuit</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>There is lawsuit against the health benefit claims they've made</li>
			<li>Excellent unbiased article which shows both sides of the argument: <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-scientific-case-against-vibrams-fivefinger-running-1575132888">here.</a></li>
			<li>Commenters say:
				<ul>
					<li>I know so many runners and coaches who use them...but these shoes are not for everybody</li>
					<li>A foot uses all five toes to stabilize and work individually...VIBRAMS ARE GREAT</li>
					<li>30 years of cushioning & stability elements being incorporated into running footwear, there is not yet clinically-based evidence in their favour either.</li>
					<li>You run faster and feel more agile, but you have to change your running style </li>
					<li>Why is the media swallowing this story wholesale rather than checking out the details</li>
					<li>I switched to barefoot running almost twenty years ago in desperation after having suffered from acute planta fasciitis for the previous twenty-five years. I have never suffered from it since.</li>
					<li>Aggravated my Achilles tendons</li>
					<li>I used to run a lot but always had a knee pain after 30-45 minutes, I bought a pair [of vibrams]. I regularly run an hour plus</li>
					<li>I loved running with my VFFâ€™s but received advice from the doctor not to. </li>
					<li>Anyone who runs hard regularly to keep fit will, sooner or later, wreck their knee joints</li>
					<li>People wreck their knees by running incorrectly</li>
