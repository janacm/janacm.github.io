What is the ideal place to position your desk?
- Facing a window?
    - Too Distracting
        - Close curatin
    - Strains eyes
- Facing door (opposite of window)
    - Could cause more glare
        - Close curtain
            - This actually is better than being against a white wall
    - In sight of bed? 
        - It'll get blocked by monitor and stuff
    -The back of your desk will look messy with wires

- Facing (current )wall
    - Lets me see the things I hang up on my wall
    - Can slip right into my chair, no need to go around my desk
    - Close to internet connection
    - Everything is already set up
    - Can mount surround speakers on wall
