        <p>
        A productivity app turned into a diary/journaling system. Instead of using a calendar normally, i.e scheduling events that will occur in the future, this app encourages you to schedule in reverse. What did you do in the last hour? Type that into RevCal, and it will populate your Google Calendar with your input. Over time, you will be able to see exactly where your time goes, and how to improve your time in a way that no automated tracking system can ever do!
