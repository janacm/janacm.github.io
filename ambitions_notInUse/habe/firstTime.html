	<h1> What is this site? </h1>
	Habit Helper is a website designed to help people changing bad habits, ranging from Facebook addiction to cocaine abuse. The idea is to help people gain awareness to why and how they have their bad habits, so that they can begin to gradually take action. A lot of the time, we act on our bad habits because our brains are on auto-pilot. We try to put you back into the driver seat.
	<h2> How it works </h2> 
	<ol>
		<li> You create an account if you want to store your data, or you use the website anonymously.</li> 
		<li> Habit helper greets you with 3 message boxes.
			<ol>
				<li> I feel an urge</li>
				<li> Its my first time here</li>
				<li> I need information </li> 
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> I feel an urge
			<ul>
				<li> This option is designed to guide the user through a process which should help them identify what triggered the urge, and methods of dealing with it. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>

	We do this by guiding people through a series of questions about their behavior

	Why I think Habit Helper will work
	
	1) All addictions are treated equal
